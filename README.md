## Future Enhancements

<ol>
	<li>Add a third party API to automatically add an artist's picture from the database instead of being a user provided url. </li>
	<li>With the API, we would also like to include updates from each artist on their detail page.</li>
	<li>Implement profiles to have the ability to search other users in order to view and comment on their artist pages.</li>
	<li>Add a video and mp4 player so users can also add their favorite video or song to an artist's page.</li>
	<li>Add a calendar widget on the home page to keep track of events related to the artists a user has added.</li>
</ol>
